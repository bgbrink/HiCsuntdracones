The Distance Dependent Decay calculates bin-wise the mean or median
interaction frequencies for any given genomic distance. This can be
done for individual chromosomes or across multiple
chromosomes. Further, the analysis can be conducted arm-wise by
splitting the individual chromosomes at the site of the centromere
(requires positional information about the centromeres).
