This tool converts (iced) Hi-C matrices generated by HiC-Pro into the
format of Homer. While the Hi-C pro matrix reports both directions of
an interaction (a -> b and b -> a), the homer format is less redundant
as it stores each interaction value of two bins under one ID. The
homer format also skips the report of zero value interactions.
